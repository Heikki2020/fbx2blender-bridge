After years of modding, I got sick of manually importing an. FBX file or more into Blender.

This app can let you double-click an .FBX file to open it in Blender.
In other words, this app tells Blender to automatically import the .FBX file you have just double-clicked.
You still have to import multiple .FBX files like before, though.

To use this app, right-click an .FBX file, choose "Open with..." and find this app in the pop-up.
You also need to select the "Always use this app to open .FBX files" to make it permanent.

Next, when it starts for the first time, this app will look for Blender at the default install location.
Or it will ask you to find Blender manually and write a small config file in your user folder.
Now, with this app acting like a bridge, Blender is basically a full-featured FBX viewer.
