After years of modding, I got tired of manually importing one or more `.FBX` files into Blender. And somehow, there still isn’t a good standalone FBX viewer—can you believe that?

I needed something that fit my workflow, especially since I often work with dozens of `.FBX` files in a single folder. This app lets you simply double-click an `.FBX` file and have it open directly in Blender. In other words, it tells Blender to automatically import the `.FBX` file you just double-clicked.

You’ll still need to import multiple `.FBX` files the usual way, but for quick previews, this makes things much faster. To use the app, right-click an `.FBX` file, choose **“Open with…”**, and select this app from the list. Be sure to check **“Always use this app to open .FBX files”** to make it permanent.

The first time it runs, the app will look for Blender in the default installation location. If it can’t find it, it will prompt you to locate Blender manually and then write a small config file to your user folder.

With this app acting as a bridge, Blender effectively becomes a full-featured FBX viewer.
